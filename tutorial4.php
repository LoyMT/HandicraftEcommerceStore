                            <ol>
                                <li>Fold a large piece of paper in half, draw a freehand half-heart shape, cut it out, and unfold to reveal the symmetrical heart.</li>
                                <li>Then, use this template to cut out two large hearts from kraft paper, poster board, or butcher paper.</li>
                                <li>Cut lots of tissue paper squares in the color of your choice of size 2 1/2 inches square.</li>
                                <li>Paint an even coat of white glue on a section of the heart.</li>
                                <li>Place the eraser-side of a pencil in the center of a square of tissue, press the tissue down against the sides of the pencil, allowing it to crease slightly, and then press the pencil down onto the glue until the tissue sticks.</li>
                                <li>Remove the pencil, and move on to the next square.</li>
                                <li>Place the next square close to the last one.  The tissue tends to 'settle' a little after you place it, so you'll need to adjust and fluff each piece as you work them into place.</li>
                                <li>Continue to add glue and complete small sections at a time.</li>
                                <li>Once you fill up the heart with tissue squares, you can go back through and fill in gaps.</li>
                                <li>Repeat the process to make two hearts.</li>
                                <li>Let them dry, and then place them back-to-back and staple together around the edges.</li>
                                <li>Use a hole punch to make a hole through both layers and add a loop of twine for hanging.</li>
                            </ol>
