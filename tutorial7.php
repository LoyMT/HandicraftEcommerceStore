                                <li>Wear gloves as you'll be putting your fingers in the dye.</li>
                                <li>Fill one container with water and set aside.</li>
                                <li>In the other container, spoon out 1/4 tsp. of dye, and add 1 cup of water heated to 140째.</li>
                                <li>Mix well to dissolve all of the dye powder, and then let cool to under 110째 (or to a point where you can put your fingers in the dye mix without it being too hot.)</li>
                                <li>1/4 teaspoon to 1 cup of water is a good starting place.</li>
                                <li>You can cut up a pipe cleaner to test the dye and see how you like it, and then you can make adjustments to get the right depth of color.</li>
                                <li>After testing the dye with a piece of a pipe cleaner, add a few to the dye bath.</li>
                                <li>Use your gloved fingers to press and squeeze the pipe cleaners, agitating and dipping them to get a full saturation.</li>
                                <li>Leave in the dye for about a minute for pastels, or 2-3 minutes for brighter colors.</li>
                                <li>Squeeze out as much dye as you can, then move them to the tray of plain water.</li>
                                <li>Place under running water for 2-3 minutes and squeeze them out a few times during the rinse to be sure all excess dye is removed. </li>
                                <li>Press out the water, then transfer them to a foil lined baking sheet, and bake for about 10 minutes at 350째, or until dry.</li>
